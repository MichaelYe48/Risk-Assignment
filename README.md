# Risk-Assignment

This project offers a python solution for risk assignment in financial datasets, often applied in auditing processes. The potential risks this program can identify are as follows:
- **a** - accounting code is missing or incorrect
- **b** - the events 1 through 15 above happen out of order (ex: invoice date is prior to purchase order date)
- **c** - bill of sale or delivery documents are missing or do not agree with amounts on invoice
- **d** - bill of sale or delivery documents are missing or do not agree with purchase order
- **e** - purchase order quantity does not agree with invoice quantity
- **g** - control documents or elements of the audit trail are missing: purchase order, bill of sale, invoice, accounting code
- **h** - the audit trail of transactions within a Department (Marketing, IT, U.M.) are inconsistent
- **i** - duplicate payments â€“ same payments to same vendor for same good/service or same payment for same service/good to two or more different vendors
- **j** - payments 2% under the threshold for competitive bidding
- **k** - payments 2% under the threshold of higher or Chief approval
- **l** - payments to a vendor for the same service/good that accumulate to be in excess of blanket purchase order or contract
- **m** - split purchase order - multiple POs to same vendor for same items
- **n** - split payments - payments to same vendor for same item and same date
